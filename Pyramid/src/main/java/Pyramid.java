     * Return a string that is a pyramid of size n, made of of asterisks and no spaces.

     * The newline character can be written as \n .
     * The tests will not be affected by a newline character at the beginning or end of the entire pyramid.

     * Here's a hint: you could use a for loop inside of a for loop for this problem. The outer for loop
     * can determine the current 'row', and the inner for loop can print an asterisk an amount of times based on the
     * current 'row'.
     *
     * @param n the size of the pyramid.
     * @return a string representation of the pyramid.
